# map-routes
Institution based path-finding application

If you happen to be an employer looking for interesting items in my portfolio (https://github.com/PeterGoedeke) then please take a look at the 'graphMap.js' file within this repository for a demonstration of my use of algorithms and data structures and the 'database_api.js' file for a demonstration of my use of currying and functional JavaScript.

This repository is the most recent that I have worked on and best represents my coding ability; most of my older repositories contain low quality code or are not well-commented as I worked on them casually when I was younger.

The back end of the application is mostly finished; the front end is mostly unfinished.
